# FitRep Tracker: Real-Time Bicep Curl CounterðŸ’ª
This project leverages computer vision techniques to estimate human poses and count repetitions of bicep curls in real-time.

Using ***Mediapipe***, a powerful machine learning framework developed by Google, the system accurately identifies and tracks key body landmarks. 

***OpenCV***, an open-source computer vision library, processes video input to detect these landmarks and visualize the results.

The project focuses on recognizing the specific motion involved in performing bicep curls. By analyzing the positions and movements of key landmarks such as the shoulders, elbows, and wrists, the system can determine when a full bicep curl is completed. It counts the repetitions and provides real-time feedback, making it an effective tool for fitness enthusiasts to monitor and improve their workout routines.

## How to run?
install the necessary dependencies:
  ```sh
  pip install mediapipe opencv-python
  ```

import the dependencies:
```
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
import numpy as np
mp_drawing = mp.solutions.drawing_utils
mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
```
Extract and run `main.py` in your IDE
